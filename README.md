Defining routes in MaterialApp for the home screen and a new details screen. 
Designed a details screen to display more information about a list item. 
Added a navigation logic to list items so tapping an item navigates to the details screen, passing the itemâ€™s data. Ensure the details screen displays the item's details accurately and includes a back button to return to the home screen.
